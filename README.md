This is a faux survey app. The user/focus group is shown three products on a page, and will click on which product they like best. There are a total of 20 products. These products will be selected at random and shown to the user, then data will be collected on how often a product was shown, of the times shown, how often was it selected. The user will be asked to make a total of 25 selections, allowing them to compare the same object multiple times against various objects to better get an idea for each products desireability. Information will than be stored in local memory to be retrieved after a page close or reload.
